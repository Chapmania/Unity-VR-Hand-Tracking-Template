## My personal Unity Oculus Quest VR Hand Tracking Template
### For Unity 2019.3.0f6

Just install the Oculus Integration and you're good to go!

- Stock renderer in linear lighting with forward rendering
- Amplify and Oculus Integration in Gitignore
- Stock modular kit with prefabs already set up
- Quality and Compression settings good to go for the Quest.
